/*
Write a programt hat creates a string that represents an 8x8 grid, using new-line
charactesr to seperate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or
a # character. The characters should form a chessboard. Passing the string to 
console.log should show this:

 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #

After making this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works
for any size, out-putting a grid of the given width and height.
